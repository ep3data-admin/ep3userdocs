What is EP3
===============

.. image:: img/logo100.jpg

EP3 provides data and research tools for the environmental proection economy in Canada and the USA.  The environmental protection econonmy is a subset of the environmental goods and services economcy, otherwise known as the green economy or cleantech.  EP3 currates and publishes data derived from public and institutional sources. EP3 brings together mature and stable open-software projects under a consistent and easy-to-use interface allowing non-specialized users to research and share data, and create interactive maps.            

Data management tools built into EP3 allow for integrated creation of data, metadata, and map visualization. Each dataset in the system can be shared publicly or restricted to allow access to only specific users. Social features like user profiles and commenting and rating systems allow for the development of communities to facilitate the use, management, and quality control of the data.

Roadmap
=======

EP3's development roadmap is documented in a series of GeoNode Improvement Projects (GNIPS).
They are documented at `GeoNode Wiki <https://github.com/GeoNode/geonode/wiki/GeoNode-Improvement-Proposals>`_.

GNIPS are considered to be large undertakings which will add a large amount of features to the project. 
As such they are the topic of community discussion and guidance. 

The community discusses these on the developer mailing list: http://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/geonode-devel/
